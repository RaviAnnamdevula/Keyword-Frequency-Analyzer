# Keyword-Frequency-Analyzer
Keyword Frequency Analyzer is a Java-based project that tracks and analyzes the frequency of keywords from an input source (file, stream, etc.). It implements various data structures like Lists, Sets, and Maps to efficiently store, retrieve, and rank keywords based on their occurrence. The project also utilizes a priority queue to display the top frequently used keywords. This tool can be applied to real-world tasks like SEO analysis, text processing, and content management, offering a flexible and extendable solution for keyword tracking and frequency analysis.

Overview
This project demonstrates different implementations of keyword storage and analysis using Java Collections (List, Set, Map) along with Java Streams and Lambda functions.
The project showcases how different data structures can be used to store, retrieve, and analyze keywords based on their frequencies. 
The keywords are read dynamically from a file, making the application more flexible for handling real-world data.

Key Features:
Three types of keyword analyzers:
    List-based: Stores keywords in a list (allowing duplicates).
    Set-based: Stores unique keywords in a set (no duplicates).
    Map-based: Stores keywords in a map along with their frequencies.
File-based input: Keywords are dynamically read from an external file (keywords.txt).
Top 5 Frequent Keywords: The map-based implementation allows users to retrieve the top 5 most frequent keywords.
Usage of Java's Comparator and Comparable: Demonstrates sorting and custom priority queue operations using these interfaces.
Exploration of Java Collections: A practical example of using List, Set, Map, PriorityQueue, and other Java collections.

**Main Components:**
Client.java: The entry point of the project where different implementations of KeyAnalyzer are used to store and analyze keywords. It reads input from keywords.txt.
KeyAnalyzer.java: Interface defining the core methods for storing and retrieving keywords.
ListKeyAnalyzerImpl.java: Implementation using a List to store keywords (allowing duplicates).
SetKeyAnalyzerImpl.java: Implementation using a Set to store unique keywords (no duplicates).
MapKeyAnalyzerImpl.java: Implementation using a Map to store keywords along with their frequency. It also provides a method to retrieve the top 5 most frequent keywords.
Keyword.java: A model class that represents a keyword and its frequency.
keywords.txt: A file that contains the list of keywords to be analyzed.

<h1>**How It Works**</h1>
The project uses different Java collections to analyze keywords:

File Input: The keywords are read from an external file (keywords.txt), making it flexible for the user to update or modify the keywords without touching the code.

Three Keyword Analyzers:

ListKeyAnalyzerImpl: Stores keywords in an ArrayList, allowing duplicates.
SetKeyAnalyzerImpl: Stores unique keywords in a HashSet, eliminating duplicates.
MapKeyAnalyzerImpl: Stores keywords in a HashMap where each keyword is mapped to its frequency count. It also uses a PriorityQueue to retrieve the top 5 most frequent keywords.
Comparators and Priority Queues: The MapKeyAnalyzerImpl uses a custom Comparator to prioritize and sort keywords based on their frequency, providing the functionality to fetch the top 5 most frequently used keywords.

Use Cases:

Display all keywords.
Show keyword frequencies.
Fetch the top 5 most frequent keywords (available only in MapKeyAnalyzerImpl).

Usage
To test the application, follow these steps:
Add Keywords: Update the keywords.txt file with a list of keywords, each on a new line.

Run the Application:
Choose the desired implementation by uncommenting the respective line in the Client.java file:

KeyAnalyzer keyAnalyzer = new ListKeyAnalyzerImpl();  // For List-based storage
KeyAnalyzer keyAnalyzer = new SetKeyAnalyzerImpl();   // For Set-based storage
KeyAnalyzer keyAnalyzer = new MapKeyAnalyzerImpl();   // For Map-based storage and frequency analysis

Run the Client.java file to analyze the keywords.

Results:
The console will display the results based on the chosen implementation, including keyword frequencies and top 5 most frequent keywords (for MapKeyAnalyzerImpl).

Example Output
Sample output for MapKeyAnalyzerImpl might look like this:
Reading keywords from the file: keywords.txt

All stored keywords:
pen
pencil
laptop
mobile
table

Keyword frequencies:
Keyword: pen, Count: 2
Keyword: pencil, Count: 2
Keyword: laptop, Count: 2
Keyword: mobile, Count: 1
Keyword: table, Count: 1

Top 5 most frequent keywords:
Keyword: pen, Frequency: 2
Keyword: pencil, Frequency: 2
Keyword: laptop, Frequency: 2
Keyword: mobile, Frequency: 1
Keyword: table, Frequency: 1


 "Keyword Frequency Analyzer" project can be useful in real-world applications, especially in scenarios where tracking and analyzing word or keyword frequency is important. Here are a few real-world use cases where such a project would be useful:

1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Analysis:
In SEO, tracking keyword usage is crucial for optimizing content to rank higher in search engines.
This project can help analyze the frequency of keywords used in blog posts, articles, or product descriptions to determine keyword density.
3. Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP):
This tool could be used for basic text analysis in NLP tasks. For instance, it could help preprocess text data by analyzing how often words or phrases appear,
which is useful for tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling.
5. Content Management and Tagging:
Platforms like content management systems or blogs often tag content with keywords.
My project can assist in analyzing the most frequent tags, helping users identify which tags are used the most across the platform.
7. Monitoring Social Media Trends:
Analyzing keyword frequency from social media posts or tweets can help track trends, hashtags, or common user discussions over a period of time.
8. Customer Feedback Analysis:
In applications where customer feedback is gathered (e.g., reviews, surveys), this tool can be used to identify frequently mentioned keywords in feedback.
This can help businesses pinpoint common issues or areas for improvement.
10. Document Management Systems:
Organizations that deal with large amounts of documentation or reports could use this analyzer to find the most common terms used, helping categorize documents or create an index for quick searching.
11. Recommendation Systems:
E-commerce sites can track the frequency of certain search terms or product keywords to better understand user interests and make personalized recommendations.
12. Academic Research:
Researchers often analyze papers, books, or research articles for keyword frequency to identify important topics or trends in a particular domain of study.
